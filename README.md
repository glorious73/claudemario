Create a 2D side-scrolling Mario-style platformer game using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each in its own file (no external libraries or frameworks). The game should include: Three playable characters (e.g., Mario, Luigi, and Noura (female character)), each selectable from a simple start screen. Three distinct levels, each with platforms, collectible coins, enemies, and a goal (e.g., a flagpole) to complete the level, and it should be about 20 seconds long to finish. Basic physics: gravity, jumping, left/right movement, and collision detection with platforms and objects. Character-specific traits (e.g., slightly different jump height or speed) to differentiate gameplay. A responsive canvas-based renderer using vanilla JavaScript. Simple UI to show score, current level, and character selection. Level progression: completing Level 1 unlocks Level 2. Completing level 2 finishes the game. Game states: start screen, gameplay, and win/lose screens. The user can toggle between day/night modes
